Here is a symfony4 shopping cart application , here you could first create your profile then,
it's available for you to add items to your cart , edit your items in cart, remove item or delete the whole cart .

The process I went through :
  - read the symfony4 documentation to understand the framework structure
  - create the class diagram for the project (attached)
  - create the ER-diagram for the database  (attached)
  - install mysql database
  - install the framework
  - connect the framework with the database and make sure everything is work.
  - create the entities and controllers
  - start implement the logic for these controller to integrate them together.


The most obstacle that I faced, is the symfony small community  ,I found the documentation  so informative
and helped me a lot , but some issues ,and run time errors that you can't find in the documentation .
